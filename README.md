# Vue Mosterslayer

A simple RPG game made entirely with vue.js. A project included with a [vue course](https://github.com/sortedcord/vue-notes)

The objective of this project is to practice all of the core vue concepts that I have learn throughout modules 2 and 3.

# Game objectives

- ### Attack
    The attack function will decrease the opponent's health but at the same time attack us as well. We won't be using a single hardcoded value so we will make it more random.
